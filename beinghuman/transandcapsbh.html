        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Being Human explores what it means to be human in the 21st century. It reflects our hopes and fears about new forms of medical knowledge, and our changing relationships with ourselves, each other and the world.</p>

		<p>Featuring 50 artworks and objects, the gallery is divided into four sections: Genetics, Minds & Bodies, Infection, and Environmental Breakdown. Discover a refugee astronaut carrying their belongings to an unknown destination, sniff a perfumed bronze sculpture that smells of breast milk, listen to an epidemic jukebox, and watch a fast-food outlet slowly flood. </p>

                    <P>Designers Kellenberger–White worked with artist Jochen Holz to create letterforms that evoke organic forms and a human touch. These hand-blown letters are made with thick amber glass. Their fluffy glow comes from helium rather than neon, the gas more usually associated with title signs. This sets off the gentle irregularities of the coloured glass, making visible the artist’s handiwork.</p>

                    <p>Our genetic code, or genome, is the blueprint of life. It provides instructions that shape every cell in the body. Revolutionary advances in research are transforming our understanding of how our bodies are made and why diseases occur. Genome editing – the ability to make precise changes to tiny sections of the genome – is opening up the hope of innovative medical treatments.
                    	 As so much seems possible, the objects in this section explore our hopes and fears about this knowledge. How much do we want to know or share about our own genetic identity?</p>

                    This image depicts Henrietta Lacks, an African American woman whose cancer cells transformed medical research, saving countless lives. The vial contains some of Lacks’s cells, which were immortal due to a genetic mutation, and continued to divide outside her body. Given the name the HeLa cell line, they were originally cultivated without the knowledge of Lacks or her family. Lacks’s story raises important questions about consent, privacy and our relationship to our complex genetic inheritance.</p>

                    <h4>Visual installation transcription</h4>
                    <p>For most of Western history, strong feelings of joy and sorrow, desire or hatred, hope and despair were thought of as “passions of the soul”. The powerful passions were distinguished from milder affections and sentiments, including familial love and compassion. Our modern category of ‘the emotions', is a much more recent invention. So how did we get from passions to emotions, and what difference has it made?</p>

                    <p>The word ‘emotion’ entered the English language from the French émotion in the 17th century. It meant a kind of physical agitation or commotion. So you might talk about the ‘emotion’ of a tree, meaning the wind was rustling its leaves, or a great ‘emotion’ among the people, meaning a public disturbance. ‘Emotion' only took on its modern, psychological meaning in the 19th century, as part of a self-consciously scientific approach to the mind.</p>

                    <p>The Scottish philosopher, who I think of as the inventor of the emotions, was Dr Thomas Brown, who died in 1820. Later pioneers, including Charles Darwin and William James, adopted Brown’s terminology and applied it to the new science of psychology.</p>

                    <p>Ever since then, scientists of the mind have tended to lump together all our feelings, sentiments, passions and affections in the capacious category of ‘the emotions’.</p>

                    <p>What difference has that made? There are two main legacies.</p>

                    <p>First, passions and affections were understood in moral terms – as good or evil. ‘The emotions', by contrast, were formed in a more secular and scientific spirit. They weren’t good or evil; they were inherited bodily inclinations – neither good nor bad in their own right, but just natural.</p>

                    <p>The second legacy is to do with the relationship between thinking and feeling. Earlier theories included categories that were both rational and emotional. So, for instance ‘affections’ and ‘sentiments’ combined reason with passion, light with heat.</p>

                    <p>The new category of ‘the emotions’, however, was from the outset starkly contrasted with the intellectual states of the mind. In this way, the contrast between the head and the heart became even more firmly entrenched.</p>

                    <p>So the next time you talk about experiencing an ‘emotion’, remember that people haven’t always talked, and written, this way. Maybe what you’re feeling is a passion, or an affection, or a sentiment, instead?</p>

                    <h4>Visual installation transcription</h4>
                     <p>We are standing in front of a large book of prints. It includes black-and-white illustrations of the facial expressions drawn by the French painter Charles Le Brun.</p>

                    <p>The illustrations capture different “passions” of the soul. </p>

                    <p>They were first created by Le Brun in 1668. He believed that the human soul showed its “passions” in the movements   of the face, and he created a visual classification system to support his idea.</p>

                    <p>This went on to be influential for many centuries.</p>

                    <p>On this open page, there is an image of a woman with a serene expression on her face. The title below describes it as a depiction of “Joy with Tranquillity”.</p>

                    <p>Underneath the image, a short caption reads: “Very little alteration is remarked in the face of those that feel within themselves the sweetness of joy.”</p>

                    <p>This suggests that the lack of any stronger expression was regarded positively. Le Brun’s work went on to declare that it was possible to judge the moral character of a person based on the way they expressed their passions. </p>

                    <p>Le Brun was, like many other 17th-century thinkers of the time, interested in rationalising, ordering and explaining the world around him. By giving names and definitions to subjective human experiences, they set in motion the deeply rooted concept of human expression as universal, and position these expressions within a hierarchy of good and bad, a system which we are still grappling with to this day. </p>

		                    <p>This engraving depicts people sacrificing a goat in front of the god of intoxication, freedom and ecstasy – known as Dionysus to the Greeks, Bacchus to the Romans.

	                     <p>This black-and-white print captures a moment of ecstatic joy, and it references an ancient festival celebrating the god of wine, known as Dionysus to the Ancient Greeks and Bacchus to the Romans.</p><p>In the centre of the image, a goat is being brought to be sacrificed while semi-naked Athenians are wearing masks and vine leaves. They dance in abandon under a Bacchus statue, who is depicted as a young child holding a bunch of grapes.</p>

						<p>In the background to the left of the main action, two women hang effigies of the god on tree branches. At a tree further in the background, a naughty goat can be seen damaging the bark of a tree.</p>

						<p>While Roman literature portrays these festivals in simplistic terms – as a space of partying and drinking – they also served an important religious function. By losing their sense of self, people could unite with the divine through their ecstatic state. This would lead to physical and mental elevation. Dionysus was a cause for joy among mortals, as he made all sorrow disappear and brought sleep and forgetfulness of daily suffering.</p>

						<p>From festivals to sports arenas, night clubs and carnivals, societies throughout history have designated spaces for ecstatic release as an important release valve from the stresses and strains of everyday life.</p>

It contains the research of the physician Abu Ali Ibn Sīnā (Avicenna), who lived between 980 and 1037 CE, and remained a medical authority for centuries. The page opening shows an anatomical drawing of the digestive and nervous system, which was where he considered psychological problems such as grief and melancholy to originate.

	                     <p>The shaping of emotional experience through internal changes in the body has long been recognised. In 1894, the American philosopher William James argued that the mental aspects of emotion, the “feeling states”, are a product of physiology – or the body’s internal signals.</p>

						<p>Our heart does not pound because we are afraid; fear arises from our pounding heart.</p>

						<p>Similarly, feelings of optimism and happiness have also been connected to changes in the body. Both heart-rate deceleration and heart-rate acceleration are observed in happiness and joy. High heart rate variability or HRV, which is the variation in the time interval between heartbeats, is associated with resilience and the potential to be both optimistic and stoical at times of adversity.</p>

						<p>How the body is today can also predict emotions tomorrow; higher rates of HRV can predict optimism levels in the future.</p>

						<p>Experiments also show that how we perceive internal bodily sensations influences how we experience emotions. As emotional feelings are thought to arise, in part, through the sensing of internal bodily changes, those individuals who are better able to sense bodily sensations, a process known as interoception, tend to experience emotions with greater intensity.</p>

						<p>Every time our heart beats, it sends a signal to our brain, so our brains are in constant and dynamic communication with our internal bodily organs. In addition to this “neural sensing” of our hearts, we can also sense them consciously – where we may suddenly become aware of their pounding, or of a skipped beat.</p>
						<p>And these changes in how our heart beats – and our neural and conscious perception of these – can help shape our emotional feeling states. That acceleration of our heart to pure joy can contribute to feelings of happiness.</p>

						<p>So, next time you feel a strong emotion, take a moment to sense associated bodily changes. Could these be contributing to how you are feeling?</p>

	                  	  <p>This book is believed to be a copy of the 17th-century Chinese encyclopedia ‘San-ts’ai t’u-hu’. It is open on a diagram depicting the ‘ruler’ of all organs, the heart, which is understood to be both the reflective and the emotional centre of a human being. In traditional Chinese medicine, different feelings are associated with different organs, and joy is located in the heart.</p>

	                     <p>The shaping of emotional experience through internal changes in the body has long been recognised. In 1894, the American philosopher William James argued that the mental aspects of emotion, the “feeling states”, are a product of physiology – or the body’s internal signals.</p>

						<p>Our heart does not pound because we are afraid; fear arises from our pounding heart.</p>

						<p>Similarly, feelings of optimism and happiness have also been connected to changes in the body. Both heart-rate deceleration and heart-rate acceleration are observed in happiness and joy. High heart rate variability or HRV, which is the variation in the time interval between heartbeats, is associated with resilience and the potential to be both optimistic and stoical at times of adversity.</p>

						<p>How the body is today can also predict emotions tomorrow; higher rates of HRV can predict optimism levels in the future.</p>

						<p>Experiments also show that how we perceive internal bodily sensations influences how we experience emotions. As emotional feelings are thought to arise, in part, through the sensing of internal bodily changes, those individuals who are better able to sense bodily sensations, a process known as interoception, tend to experience emotions with greater intensity.</p>

						<p>Every time our heart beats, it sends a signal to our brain, so our brains are in constant and dynamic communication with our internal bodily organs. In addition to this “neural sensing” of our hearts, we can also sense them consciously – where we may suddenly become aware of their pounding, or of a skipped beat.</p>
						<p>And these changes in how our heart beats – and our neural and conscious perception of these – can help shape our emotional feeling states. That acceleration of our heart to pure joy can contribute to feelings of happiness.</p>

						<p>So, next time you feel a strong emotion, take a moment to sense associated bodily changes. Could these be contributing to how you are feeling?</p>
